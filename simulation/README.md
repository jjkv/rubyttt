# Comp105 Recitation: Tic Tac Toe Simulation

In this directory you will find two files: 

 1. `ttt.rb` contains the definition of class `RandomTTT`, which
    simulates a random game of Tic Tac Toe to completion.

 2. `board.rb` contain the definition of class `Board`, which
    represents a 3x3 board on which many different games can be played,
    including Tic Tac Toe!

You can run the simulation with `ruby ttt.rb`

Once you've got it working, you should see something like this:

```

Many methods of these classes have already been defined for you, but some
have not. Your task is to complete the definitions of both classes in order to 
produce a working Tic Tac Toe simulator. You will do this by implementing the 
following methods:
